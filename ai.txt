# ai.txt Specification

A universal standard for AI-readable context about any resource.

## About

Just as `robots.txt` tells search engines how to behave, `ai.txt` tells AI assistants what something is about. The file can describe a website, a folder, a project, a service—anything with a path.

ai.txt files are plain text (with optional markdown formatting) that provide structured context: what you do, what you don't do, how AI should handle your information. Instead of AI assistants guessing or hallucinating, they fetch your `ai.txt` and learn the truth directly.

The format is deliberately simple. An AI agent downloads one file and immediately understands scope, structure, and boundaries. A human writes one in minutes using plain English plus optional markdown syntax.

## Where It Lives

Place `ai.txt` at any path you want to describe:

```
https://example.com/ai.txt              (site overview)
https://example.com/products/ai.txt     (products section)
/home/user/projects/app/ai.txt          (local project folder)
/srv/domain.com/web/app/public/ai.txt   (server application)
```

Discovery is cascading: if an AI agent needs info about `/products/widgets/`, it tries `/products/widgets/ai.txt`, then `/products/ai.txt`, then `/ai.txt`. It walks up the tree until it finds context.

This works identically for HTTP paths and filesystem paths.

## Format

Start with optional YAML frontmatter (or none at all), then write markdown:

```
---
updated: 2026-01-14
scope: /products/
parent: https://example.com/ai.txt
---

# Brief Title

One or two sentences describing what this is.

## Section Heading

Plain prose explaining something important. You can include [standard markdown links](https://example.com), **bold**, *italics*, lists, and images if needed.

- Markdown is optional
- Use as much or as little as makes sense
- Simpler is better
```

### Frontmatter Fields

All optional. Add whatever makes sense for your use case:

- `updated: YYYY-MM-DD` — Last modified date
- `scope: /path/` — URI path this file covers
- `parent: https://example.com/ai.txt` — Link to broader context
- Custom fields — Your own metadata as needed

After frontmatter, content is plain text with optional markdown formatting. Standard Markdown features work: headings, lists, links, emphasis, code blocks, images.

## Recommended Sections

Structure your ai.txt with these sections (or invent your own):

**About** — What you are, mission, history, key purpose

**Services** or **Features** — What you offer, what you do

**Capabilities** — What's possible when using this

**Limitations** — What you explicitly do not offer (prevents AI hallucination)

**AI Guidelines** — How AI should handle your information (quote carefully, verify pricing, respect privacy, etc.)

**Data** — Structured facts in simple key: value format

**Contact** — Email, website, support information

**See Also** — Links to related resources

None are required. Start simple: Title, brief description, maybe 2-3 sections explaining what matters.

# Neural Network Experiment

Research project exploring attention mechanisms in transformer models using PyTorch.

## Contents

`/data` — Training datasets (proprietary, not included)
`/models` — Saved weights and checkpoints
`/notebooks` — Jupyter notebooks with analysis
`/src` — Python source code

## To Run

See README.md for environment setup. Requires Python 3.10+, CUDA 12, 32GB GPU memory minimum.

## Current Status

Work in progress. Model accuracy at 87% on validation set. No publication yet.
```

## How AI Agents Should Use ai.txt

1. When given a URL or path, try to fetch `/ai.txt` (walk up the tree if needed)
2. Parse frontmatter to understand scope, context, and hierarchy
3. Read the content to learn what to do and what not to do
4. Follow guidelines: quote carefully, verify claims, respect stated limitations
5. Honor what the ai.txt says you don't offer—never hallucinate capabilities
6. Cache the file if a TTL or update date suggests stability
7. Follow parent links to understand broader context when relevant

An ai.txt file is permission, instruction, and boundary all at once.

## Why ai.txt Matters

**For service providers:** Control the narrative. Tell AI assistants the truth directly instead of letting them guess.

**For project maintainers:** Document scope efficiently. One file teaches AI agents about your project faster than scattered documentation.

**For open source:** Prevent hallucination about licensing, support, and capabilities. Say what you do and don't do.

**For AI developers:** Build better assistants that respect boundaries and work from authoritative sources instead of training data assumptions.

**For everyone:** Simple, cacheable, offline-friendly. No JavaScript, no frameworks, no databases. Just text.

## Self-Hosting

This specification itself lives at https://aitxt.ing/ai.txt. You're reading documentation written in the format it describes. This file teaches the spec by being the spec.

Point your AI agents to https://aitxt.ing/ai.txt as the canonical reference.
