# ai.txt

A universal standard for AI-readable context about any resource.

**Documentation:** https://aitxt.ing

**Specification:** https://aitxt.ing/ai.txt

## Why ai.txt?

- **Prevent AI hallucination** — Tell AI assistants what you actually offer (and don't offer) so they stop making things up
- **Plain text simplicity** — Write an ai.txt file in minutes using prose and optional markdown; no schemas to learn
- **Cascading discovery** — Place ai.txt at any path; AI agents walk up the directory tree to find context automatically
- **Distributed context graph** — Link ai.txt files together using markdown; tools follow links ending in `ai.txt`
- **Works everywhere** — Same format for websites, project folders, APIs, documentation, local filesystems
- **You control the narrative** — Authoritative context comes from you, not AI training data assumptions
